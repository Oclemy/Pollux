# Pollux
Pollux is the easiest yet reliable recyclerview adapter you will ever find. Only two lines of code, no need to extend classes or create any viewholder. It uses data binding to generate code for you.

## Installation

The library is hosted in jitpack. So start by adding jitpack url as shown below in your project-level build.gradle:

```groovy
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Then specify the dependency in your module-level build.gradle:

```groovy
	    dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.Oclemy:Pollux:Tag'
	    }
```
